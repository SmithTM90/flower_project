      <h1 id="detailHeading">Petunias</h1>
      <p id="p3">Watering Requirements: Every 7-10 days</p>
      <p id="p1">Proper watering keeps your petunia plants healthy and helps them produce abundant blooms. While these annual flowers have few care requirements, regular irrigation is a must. Deep watering helps the petunias produce long, healthy roots. Watering lightly and frequently is harmful as the petunias grow weak, with shallow roots, which inhibits their ability to seek out moisture and soil nutrients.</p>
      <p id="p2">Plant petunias in well-draining beds. Avoid locations where water tends to collect after rain or irrigation, as petunias cannot tolerate soggy soils. Newly planted petunias need evenly moist soil for the first few weeks after planting, to establish a healthy root system. Once established, reduce watering to once every 7 to 10 days. Provide 1 to 2 inches of water at each irrigation, which is enough water to moisten the top 6 to 8 inches of soil. Petunias can tolerate mild drying but the soil shouldn't be allowed to dry out completely.</p>

      <h1 id="detailHeading">Marigolds</h1>
      <p id="p3">Watering Requirements: Once Per Week</p>
      <p id="p1">Few annuals are as dependably cheerful as marigolds (Tagetes patula). Easy to grow and long-blooming, these reliable plants start flowering in early summer and continue until frost if their old blooms are snipped. They also attract butterflies and hummingbirds into the garden. Marigolds grow best if watered deeply at least once a week.</p>
      <p id="p2">Established marigolds in garden beds need a good soak once each week. Give them enough water so that the soil is moist to a depth of 6 to 8 inches. If the weather is unusually hot or windy, they'll need extra water. Water marigolds in pots when the top 1 to 2 inches of soil is dry. If your marigolds stop flowering in hot weather, give them some extra water, which often restarts flower bud formation.</p>

      <h1 id="detailHeading">Daisies</h1>
      <p id="p3">Watering Requirements: 1-inch Each Week</p>
      <p id="p1">Perennial gardeners who plant low-maintenance plants know that Shasta daisies belong in borders of daylilies, coneflowers and August lilies. Given a brunch of well-rotted compost each spring, they produce sunny white flowers from late May or early June through the summer and into fall. Of course, like any lady, this daisy appreciates a little attention when she wilts.</p>
      <p id="p2">Too much high nitrogen fertilizer may lead to droopy plants; a thin layer of well-rotted compost will keep them healthy and perky. Too much water also promotes wilting. Plants need about an inch of water a week. They begin growing upward again when heavy rains end.</p>

      <p id="p3">Watering Requirements: Every 1-3 Days</p>
      <p id="p1">Too much or too little water for your roses can lead to stunted growth, thin and weak flowers and petals and browning in the leaves. The amount of water roses need varies by climate, including rainfall and temperature, but there are some basic guidelines you can follow.</p>
      <p id="p2">How often to water depends greatly on the climate in your area. Climates that feature little rainfall and high temperatures will require you to water much more frequently. Roses growing in an area where the temperature rises near or above 90 degrees every day should be watered every day. Highs in the 80s indicate watering every other day, in the 70s every third day, and so on. If your soil receives more than 1 inch of rain, do not water your roses. If you live in an area that features high winds, roses may dry out faster, so constant high winds should lead you to water a day earlier than your schedule would otherwise dictate.</p>

      <p id="p3">Watering Requirements: Once Each Week</p>
      <p id="p1">Sun-loving verbena, a butterfly favorite, is sometimes described as a see-through plant, because its long flowering stems do not obstruct the view of other bedding plants and flowers.</p>
      <p id="p2">Apply 1 inch of water at least once a week or whenever the soil appears dry, but not to the point of saturation. Water the plants at soil level and not from overhead, digging into the soil to a depth of 6 inches to check for moisture and watering until the soil is damp to that depth. Check the soil moisture about once a week during average weather and every other day during hot, dry weather.</p>

      <p id="p3">Watering Requirements: Every 3-7 Days</p>
      <p id="p1">The word "hydrangea" means "water vessel" in Greek, so it's not surprising that hydrangeas (Hydrangea spp.) are water-loving plants. Most species thrive on moist, well drained soil in an area with some shade.</p>
      <p id="p2">The ideal watering schedule for hydrangeas depends on many variables, like species of hydrangea, daytime temperatures, type of soil, time of year, amount of shade and level of precipitation.Horticulturists at North Dakota State University offer the following guideline regarding frequency of irrigation: water enough to prevent wilting. Generally, this means you'll need to water hydrangeas once or twice a week during the summer season. Water in the morning or evening rather than in the heat of the day, and avoid overhead irrigation. Hydrangeas are dormant in winter, so no irrigation is required.</p>

      <h1 id="detailHeading">Lilies</h1>
      <p id="p3">Watering Requirements: Every 2-3 Days</p>
      <p id="p1">Asiatic lilies are hardy plants that requires only minimal maintenance to bloom well. These lilies come in every color but blue, but they do not produce the fragrance of other lily varieties. The primary concern when caring for Asiatic lilies is proper watering, as too little or too much moisture can inhibit flowering or lead to plant decline.
      </p>
      <p id="p2">Most Asiatic lilies are planted in the fall. After planting new bulbs, water the lily bed thoroughly so it's moistened to a 6-inch depth. Continue to water as needed to maintain the moisture in the soil until the ground begins to freeze. Resume watering in spring, once new growth appears. Generally, if the soil feels dry at a 1-inch depth, the lilies require irrigation. In the heat of summer this can be as often as every two to three days.</p>

      <p id="p3">Watering Requirements: 2-inches Each Week</p>
      <p id="p1">Tulips grow and bloom in late winter and early spring, bringing bright color to otherwise sleepy gardens. These bulb plants are equally successful in pots, both in the house and in the garden. Potted tulips require the same planting times, placement and care as outdoor tulips if they're to bloom in spring, so buy some tulips bulbs in fall and get started.</p>
      <p id="p2">Water sprouted tulips with 2 inches of water a week to maintain consistent soil moisture, and keep them in full sun for six to eight hours a day.</p>

      <p id="p3">Watering Requirements: 1 to 2-inches Each Week</p>
      <p id="p1">Geraniums (Pelargonium spp.) aren't just easy on the eyes -- they're easy on your green thumb, too. The flowers need little maintenance, tolerating many kinds of soil, surviving periodically dry conditions and resisting most insect pests.</p>
      <p id="p2">Water geraniums once every couple of days, or as necessary to keep the soil consistently moist but never soggy. You may need to increase how often you water your geraniums if you notice their leaves wilting or yellowing. When you water, use enough water to moisten the soil to a depth of 8 to 12 inches. This encourages deeper root growth, which in turn enhances overall plant vigor and health. Additionally, always water your geranium at its base. Geraniums do not do well with overhead irrigation, since damp foliage makes the plant susceptible to various diseases.</p>

      <p id="p3">Watering Requirements: Every 3-7 Days</p>
      <p id="p1">Rhododendrons are shrubs known for their beautiful flowers. They vary in size and shape, and can grow in most locations if cared for properly. Watering them can be tricky, and, if not done correctly, can kill them.</p>
      <p id="p2">Water your rhododendron twice a week for the first few years after it has been planted. Rhododendron roots grow close to the surface, which means they need water more frequently. Adjust the amount of water to the size of the shrub. You want the soil to get moist, but stop right before water settles on the top. You can test this out on a patch of soil where your rhododendron isn't growing.</p>

      <p id="p3">Watering Requirements: Every 2-3 Days</p>
      <p id="p1">Begonias are a large and diverse group, with more than 1,300 species and a multitude of cultivars and hybrids. They're divided into eight separate groups, with care varying somewhat from group to group.</p>
      <p id="p2">When they are growing, keep begonias moist. During hot summer weather, container plants may need watering two or three times a week. For garden plants, hardy begonia should be kept constantly moist but not soggy, and semperflorens begonia, although they do best when kept moist, will tolerate some drought because of their thick leaves. Rex begonia needs high humidity. Allow the soil surface to dry between waterings.</p>

      <p id="p1">Pansies require little care and maintenance, making them a good choice for beginning gardeners and experts alike. Pansies do need a good dose of water once planted, and you may need to supplement rainfall during dry spells.
      </p>
      <p id="p2">Pansies need about 1 inch of water each week during the growing season. In many cases, rainfall in your area may meet the flowers needs. You will need to water the plants all spring and summer during dry spells. Avoid watering the plants in the late afternoon or evening, when the heat can cause much of the moisture to quickly evaporate, the West Virginia University Extension Service advises.</p>
